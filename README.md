# The Unlimited ISP

Using JavaScript or another language through parsing or other techniques to enable the ability to divide street addresses into serviceable and not currently serviceable and then direct to the proper page based on that decision. Seneca Illinois will be serviceable in the beginning. All other places in the United States will be not currently serviceable but allow them to input information for us to build a database of areas that we should expand too.  

starlink.com has a user serviceable setup that is like what we are going to do

# The Unlimited Admin Portal 

Needs to have a user login dedicated to internal use 

The service information forms, and customer accounts need to be accessible from somewhere and this is a logical place for that to exist 

I absolutely love the idea of being able to go between sections within a GUI without having to force a page reload. Let us keep that theory consistent throughout everything that we develop together. 

Main Menu -  

Home ‚Äì customizable dashboard with widgets that make viewing certain statistics about the internal contents of the site seamless 

Open Tickets ‚Äì a pane that shows all open customer tickets regardless of status. Within this pane tickets will be organized by status via an internal menu structure that I will break down as we get closer to this part of development 

User Submissions ‚Äì a pane that shows all customer submissions for serviceability, segmented into an internal interface by serviceable, not currently serviceable, and not serviceable. I would like this pane to be smooth transitions and easy represented and quantifiable data that further code can be built on top of to develop marketing strategies and ways of identifying built out scenarios.  

Customer Accounts ‚Äì a pane that serves the use of being able to access the account information of any customer.  

All account data that is acquired will be available here.  

Billing data will be available but only the last four of the credit cards.  

Ability to update information manually should be available to administrator level users 

Ticket history will be available here and will synchronize with the open ticket data being edited within open tickets in near real time if possible 

An account logo and edit account + logout capabilities like the customer account 

I envision a menu bar on the left-hand side of the screen and when you hover over the logo, we use for each section the text for the section appears so for example you hover over the notepad and ‚ÄúOpen Tickets‚Äù appears 

This is also where I envision the ability to keep backups, network monitoring and inventory in the future. Those will be smaller additions. I will add detail into this section as I further refine how I want this part.
